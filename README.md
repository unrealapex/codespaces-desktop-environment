# Codespace Graphics Environment
This repository is a template to create Codespaces with a graphical
environment. It is useful when testing applications that require a GUI. It
comes with a window manager(Fluxbox) which is acessible via noVNC through a
forwarded port.

The password for noVNC is set to `vscode` by default.
